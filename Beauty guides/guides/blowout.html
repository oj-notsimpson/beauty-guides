   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
     <li> Wash and condition your hair. Achieving the perfect blowout requires clean hair.</li>
     <li>Blot hair dry. Trying to blow-dry dripping wet hair is a bad idea, as it will take forever. </li>
    <li>The next key step in achieving a smooth, sleek blowout is to apply some good styling product to the hair, while it's still damp.</li>
    <li>Begin to rough dry your hair. Turn your hairdryer to the medium heat setting (the high setting is usually too hot for anything but extremely thick, coarse hair) and begin to roughly dry your hair, using only your fingers.</li>
    <li>Brush out your hair and divide it into sections. </li>
    <li>Blow dry using a round brush. Divide each section of hair into 2 inch (5.1 cm)-wide pieces and begin blowdrying with a mixed-bristle round brush.</li>
    <p><strong>Remember to work from the front to back and from top to bottom.</strong></p>
    <li>Set your hair and add some finishing product. Once the final section of hair is completely dry, remove all of the clips or rollers, shake out your hair and give it a final blast using the cold setting on your hairdryer.</li>
    <h5>Maintain your blowout.</h5>
      <p>   A blowout hairstyle can last for several days if you learn how to maintain it properly.
        Use dry shampoo to eliminate any greasiness and add volume and texture to your hair on the days following your blowout.
        Use a thick, plastic shower cap to prevent steam from frizzing up your hair in the shower.
        At night, loosely twist and pin your hair into sections and wrap a silk scarf around your head to avoid the friction that causes tangles and frizz. Alternatively, try sleeping on a silk or satin pillowcase.
